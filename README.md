# 1-Design Welcome Screen :

In this initial phase, we meticulously crafted the Welcome Screen for the App. Utilizing Android Studio's layout editor, we engineered a welcoming interface designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing. 
As a foundational step, we established crucial dependencies, including Retrofit for seamless API integration and Room for efficient local storage. Furthermore, we diligently implemented the MVVM architecture,
providing a robust structural framework for the application.

# 2-Designing Chat Screen :

In this phase, our attention shifts towards crafting the Chat Screen. Our meticulous approach involves building a user interface with a RecyclerView, implementing DiffUtil for efficient UI updates, and seamlessly
integrating the MVVM architecture to manage data effectively. As we progress through this part, the Chat Screen evolves into a sophisticated space ready to elegantly display messages, ensuring a seamless and 
visually engaging user experience.

# 3-Advanced Features :

In this pivotal stage, We have diligently implemented internet connectivity checks to ensure a seamless user experience. Leveraging the Clipboard Manager, users can effortlessly copy messages,while Share Intents 
facilitate quick sharing of messages across different applications. Furthermore, we've empowered users with the ability to select and manipulate text within the chat, adding an extra layer of interactivity. 
The inclusion of intuitive popup menus enhances overall user interactions, contributing to a sophisticated and dynamic app experience.

# 4-Integrating OpenAI API :

In this pivotal stage, we seamlessly integrated the OpenAI API into our application using Retrofit, unlocking the potential for engaging chat interactions powered by GPT-3. Our implementation involved making 
precise API requests, adeptly handling responses, and prioritizing secure API key management to safeguard user interactions. This strategic integration opens up a world of possibilities for dynamic and intelligent
conversations within the app, enriching the user experience with the advanced capabilities of GPT-3.

# 5-Room Database Integration :

In this crucial phase, we seamlessly incorporated the Room Database into our chat screen. By setting up Room, we established a robust mechanism to store chat history locally, empowering users to access their conversations even in offline scenarios. This integration is pivotal for ensuring a seamless user experience, as it enhances the app's functionality by providing persistent access to chat interactions, regardless of the user's connectivity status.
